# SolarSystem-in-Virtual-Reality
A solar system model made for Virtual Reality on the Web.

This is just an educational project I made to enhance my hands-on with Virtual Reality on the web.
I'm planning on adding more functionalities, more content like names and texts, and also realistic planetary attributions. i.e. real rotation, revolution, no. of moons, astroid belts etc...

To Run:
>you'll need a local server (as browsers block texture renders).
>I used 'XAMPP' to host my project on a localhost.
>download the files.
>open your server conf file.
>change the directory path on the conf file to where this project folder is stored on you computer.
>open browser and type localhost/solarsystem.html.
>boom now you know what your solarsystem looks like.
